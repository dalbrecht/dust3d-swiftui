# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add a separate SwiftUI editor with per-window documents, node selection and front/side movement, coordinate/radius editing, undo/redo, native open/save, and asynchronous mesh preview.
- Share the Metal renderer between viewer and editor; package and check Qt-free linkage for both apps.

- Add lossless editor archive storage, validated node commands, bounded undo/redo transactions, atomic file persistence, and measured coverage gates.

- Consume the Qt-free engine from a pinned external core revision and remove the duplicate Apple-side native adapter.

- Add a Qt-free C++17 engine library and C bridge, with validated `.ds3` archive loading.
- Add a native SwiftUI/Metal macOS viewer with file opening, orbit/zoom, wireframe, and camera fitting.
- Pin c65llc coding standards, assemble Codex instructions, and document native/C++ supplements and gaps.
- Add document-loading regression tests, native validation commands, and a local app bundle/run script.

Original Dust3D release history remains in `CHANGELOGS`.
